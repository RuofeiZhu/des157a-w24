        <img src="food/placeholder.png" class="photo" alt="placeholder">
        <img src="food/cowbonemarrow.jpg" class="photo" alt="Bovine Bone Marrow" data-description="A French restaurant called Bistro Jeanty, in Youtville, CA. The left one is escargo, the right one is Beef Marrow.">
        <img src="food/breakfast.jpg" class="photo" alt="Breakfast" data-description="This was shoot in my hometown, Wuhan, in the central part of China. It is a place renowned for its diverse breakfast options. A delicious breakfast canteen can always attract large crowds waiting and standing around it. Thus, people often find themselves eating on the street, seated on small chairs and using taller ones as tables.">
        <img src="food/dianxin.jpg" class="photo" alt="Chadian Cuisine" data-description="This was captured in Wuxi, Eastern city in China. Their food is exquisite, showing some traditional Chinese cuisine, also some modern combination with ancient 'Cha Dian' ('Cha' means tea, 'dian' means 'cuisine.'). The left bottom is a flower made with cheese, pouring some lemonade juice on it.">
        <img src="food/placeholder.png" class="photo" alt="placeholder">
        <img src="food/turkish.jpg" class="photo" alt="Turkish Meal" data-description="Can you guess where these dishes come from? My friend always says that this Turkish restaurant is so good compared to other restaurants around her home (she studies in Sheffield, UK). I didn't take this seriously, but one day we just passed by this restaurant and decided to eat there. Then, I was like, 'This is sooooo good!' All the meat, rice and naan are really tender and umami. The sauces on the salad is also fresh, with the sweetness and sourness balanced perfectly. Some dishes are accompanied by plain yogurt to aid in digesting the meat, which is a new way of combining foods for me. ">
        <img src="food/escargo.jpg" class="photo" alt="Escargo" data-description="Can you guess what is this? A different cooking way of escargo in Wuhan. I found this restaurant in a TV show. After visiting it for the first time, I became a fan. I have never failed to order any dish that is not good. Each time I go to this restaurant I will order this fired spicy escargo.">
        <img src="food/family.jpg" class="photo" alt="Family Meal" data-description="This is a family meal celebrating someone's birthday. There are many local vegetables that seldomly see in other places, such as pumpkin vine, red spinich (After stir-frying, it will release a red broth), glebionis coronaria, sour beans (similar to pickles but with a different taste), Edamame, and etc. There are also various traditionally cooked meats, like chicken broth, spicy garlic crawfish cooked with beer, braised pork knuckle, stewed beef, fried chicken gizzards and etc. This was the first largest family meal I had upon returning to Wuhan after almost two years studying abroad in Davis. I took this picture last summer.">

        <!-- two -->
        <img src="food/niushemian.jpg" class="photo" alt="Niushemian" data-description="This is a beef tongue noodle with spicy smashed potatoes, coriander, green onion, and suancai. The restaurant is located at the North Bund in Shanghai. Last summer, I was just hanging around, having nothing to do, and randomly picked this restaurant. This was one of the most delicious noodle dishes that left a deep impression on me.">
        <img src="food/placeholder.png" class="photo" alt="placeholder">
        <img src="food/macau.jpg" class="photo" alt="Macau Dish" data-description="This is a deep-fried, long-shaped sea fish. It was so tender that it surprised me. Although I forgot the name of both the fish and the dish, it left a deep impression on me. From this photo, we can also get a glimpse of a traditional Cantonese restaurant, such as the tableware.">
        <img src="food/korean1.jpg" class="photo" alt="Korean Cuisine" data-description="Every time I go to LA, I will go to the Ktown for food. The Korean seafood soup, bibimbap, and samgye-tang were delicious. We were a group of eight people at this meal. While I didn't capture photos of each dish, we shared a variety of food, and it left me satisfied with this experience, haha.">
        <img src="food/french3.jpg" class="photo" alt="French Cuisine 3" data-description="This is also a French dish called Blanquette de Lapin, with bacon-wrapped rabbit legs, wide spagetti, and morel mushrooms. It's my first time eating rabbit leg meat, but it's really good. The top left is a stewed beef, which is really tender and also delicious.">
        <img src="food/nang.jpg" class="photo" alt="Nang" data-description="The right combo is the traditional Peking Duck, and the left one is Guobianmo (Pot-Side naan), a famous dish in Wuhan. The thicker part is soft, and the longer part is crispy. The basic procedure is to stick dough to the inside of a very large pot and letting the dough slide a certain distance before it stops for a few seconds, and then it is peeled off. This is really good! It's from one of the famous restaurants in Wuhan that serves almost over 100 dishes. This restaurant is among the largest I've ever encountered. It has the capacity to accommodate around 200 people dining, and the restaurant is as large as a maze. Each time I go there, I'll be guided to a completely different place to eat. Although it is really big, there is always a huge line in front of it, even with chairs intentionally placed for waiting people.">
        <img src="food/tieguodun.jpg" class="photo" alt="Tieguodun" data-description="This is called TieGuoDun (iron pot stew), a famous dish from Dongbei, the northern part of China. It is always slow-cooked with a variety of ingredients, such as chicken, beef, lamb, or pork, in a large iron pot. Traditionally, the pot is placed over firewood to preserve its original flavor. This pot's uneven heat distribution is recently being taken advantage of by placing dough in the dish. This allows the dough to absorb enough broth, giving it a wonderful flavor.">
        <img src="food/niurouguo.jpg" class="photo" alt="Niurouguo" data-description="This is a braised beef pot. It's hard to tell the differences in cooking methods between different countries and regions, but this one is really good. This restaurant specializes in Northwestern Chinese cuisine,  which is known for its robust and original flavors, often featuring substantial use of beef, lamb.  Dishes are typically hearty and filling, designed to provide sustenance in the cold, arid climate of China's Northwest region.">
        <img src="food/french2.jpg" class="photo" alt="French Cuisine 2" data-description="The top right is a plate of mussels, prepared with herbs and garlic, accompanying with a slice of toasted bread. In the center of the table is a dish of duck legs, which is tender and flavorful.On the bottom right, we have what appears to be beef tartare, a classic French dish made with raw, finely chopped or ground beef.   The garnishes on the side, such as capers, onions, and a small salad sause, enrich fthe lavor of the meat.  We always call this dish 'chasing the cow for a bite' haha. The bottom left dish is a stewed pork with a sauce and crunchy crust. But if comparing it with the duck leg, I prefer duck leg, which is more tender.">
        <!-- three -->
        <img src="food/yangxiezi.jpg" class="photo" alt="Yangxiezi" data-description="This is a lamb spine hotpot, a famous Beijing dish. If the lamb spine is fresh, no matter how it's cooked, it will always be delicious and tender. The only thing is to stew it for enough time. This place serves generous portions, and I really enjoyed eating there. Lamb spine is my life dish.">
        <img src="food/shanyumian.png" class="photo" alt="Shanyumian" data-description="This is Asian Swamp Eel Noodle, right near my home. It is super popular in my area; if you don't go there early, it will be sold out quickly. The soup version is only served in the morning, and this stir-fried version is available before noon. It is soooooo good!!! It includes Wuhan's classic alkaline noodles, eel, onions, chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, and some seasonings. Whenever I don't know what to eat, I go to this restaurant. It's hard to find anything that doesn't taste good there. It's also cheap since it's street food. It's like only 4 dollars per serving.">
        <img src="food/tiandihaozhai.jpg" class="photo" alt="Tiandihaozhai" data-description="This is a seafood pot, which includes chicken feet, abalone, and many other ingredients. I really can't remember what the left dish is, but I remember it tasted even better than the seafood hot pot.">
        <img src="food/placeholder.png" class="photo" alt="placeholder">
        <img src="food/coffee.jpg" class="photo" alt="Coffee" data-description="It's a well-designed coffee. The foam cream is super attractive, but it's really expensive, which makes it less enjoyable.">
        <img src="food/wenzhou.jpg" class="photo" alt="Wenzhou Dish" data-description="It's a street from Wenzhou, a coastal city, so the seafood there is really good. This is a bowl of oyster noodles. I really like oysters, so it's really good, haha.">
        <img src="food/xiejiaomian.jpg" class="photo" alt="Xiejiaomian" data-description="On the right side is Crab Claw Noodles, a famous dish in Wuhan. It contains crab claws and noodles, seasoned with soy sauce and various spices, which makes it really tasty. The bottom left dish is Grilled Eel, a snake-like fish. If cooked well, it has no fishy smell and will be really tender. The top left dish is Stinky Tofu, different from the stinky tofu from Sichuan and Changsha's black version. All of them are super delicious.">
        <img src="food/macau2.jpg" class="photo" alt="Portuguese Cuisine" data-description="This is a Portuguese cuisine, Baked Apple. It's hard to describe it's flavor, but it's good combining with the sauces that is not really sweet. The restaurant is located in Macau, where the Portuguese colonized for centuries, and the dish has become authentic there. Although I didn't capture all the dishes on the table, I want to mention the seafood rice, which is different from the Spanish version, as it includes soup. This restaurant is quite small, with fewer than eight tables for two, but it has won Michelin star for a consistent seven years. (The price is reasonable.)">
