        <p>This will be a further improvement of the <strong class="strong">Every Picture</strong> project.</p>

            1. <span class="unique-serif">I'm going to enhance the scrolling effect as expected:</span> when users scroll down the page, the first text scrolls out of the screen, and the second one follows, providing an overall introduction to the zoomed photos. <br>
            2. <span class="unique-serif">I'll also focus more on the transition animation when a user clicks on an image.</span> If possible, I might add a function to ensure users can exit the overlay by clicking any part of the shadow.<br>
            3. <span class="unique-serif">The title design may also be changed to be more consistent with other projects.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            To better improve the project's UX/UI and functionality, I asked three friends who have little understanding of web design to share their 'foodie' experience. All of them really liked the topic and format. There aren't a bunch of photos that overwhelm people. I'll also TA after trying my best to solve problems.<br>
            <strong class="strong">Friend A</strong> used a phone and a laptop to test this website. She found out that the photo is stretched when she clicks on it on the phone. <br>
            <strong class="strong">Friend B</strong> found that the photo captions are really interesting, providing detailed descriptions. She also gave me some suggestions about correcting some grammar mistakes. <br>
            <strong class="strong">Friend C</strong> found that the close button is a little small. It would be better to be able to exit the overlay effect wherever she clicks outside the shadow part.
