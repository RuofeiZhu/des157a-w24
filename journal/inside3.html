                <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>

                    The article discusses the benefits of using engaging photos from The New York Times to encourage students to slow down and closely examine what is presented to them. By noticing small details and contemplating the events captured in the images, students can broaden their curiosity about the world and spark new ideas.

                    Here is one website <i><a href="https://trionn.com/">Trionn </i></a> which uses fantastic animation and layout interaction to capture users' attention. The mouse icon is replaced with a cyan circle, and as it moves, it generate cyan gas to the direction the mouse goes. When scrolling the page, the the main laptop photo zooms out, magnifying its main function. While the cyan mouse moves across the photos, it has a color overlay interaction with the photos below. The smooth goes-in sections also captures attention. The end section with its name at the bottom, the mouse turns into a flashlight to lighting the name.
