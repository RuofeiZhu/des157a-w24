                <p>
                    I'm excited about this photo because it shows not only the food but also the setting where and how people enjoy their meals. This photo was captured in my hometown, a place renowned for its diverse breakfast options. A delicious breakfast canteen can always attract large crowds waiting and standing around it. Thus, people often find themselves eating on the street, seated on small chairs and using taller ones as tables.

                    My project aims to document the various foods I've encountered around the world. I really like trying different foods, taking photographs, and travelling. I want to make this photographic journey engaging and enjoyable. I hope that visitors to my page will be curious, asking questions like, "What is this? What's the story behind this dish? What ingredients are used in it?" and more.

                    I consider myself a food enthusiast who enjoys discovering and making new dishes. I believe food is a way to connect people. If we travel to one place, the most direct way to learn about their culture is to find the most authentic food. While for this one, it portrays my hometown's breakfast scenery.

                    On the right is the photo by one of my classmate, Ophelia. Her photo is about her mantis during 5 years.

                    The most interesting one is the green male praying mantis with translucent wings and little longer than the others. As a person who is a little afraid of insects, it’s really interesting to hear someone introduce their pet about their habit and how to recognize the differences between the same species.

                <p>
                    The most obvious thing is that the praying mantis seems not scary as I thought before. The most mysterious aspect is that if not introduced to their habit and life time, I won’t know they only live from spring to winter.
